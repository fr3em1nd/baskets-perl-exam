## Grocery Basket Test

You have data in the following JSON format:
`
[

    {

        "name":"apples",

        "baskets":[10,20,30]

    },

    {

        "name":"bananas",

        "baskets":[5,20,10,10]

    }

]
`
name is the name of a grocery product.

baskets is a list that contains the quantity in each basket sold.

Write a Perl script that displays for each product the total number of baskets and the total number of products. For example:

60 apples in 3 baskets

45 bananas in 4 baskets

    The script need not accept any arguments; the above data can be hard-coded.
    The script need not convert from JSON. You may choose to hard-code the data in a structure of your choice.
    The script MUST calculate the results; it MUST NOT print hard-coded results.
